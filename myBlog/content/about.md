&emsp;&emsp;长到这么大，我说不出来我最爱的一部电影，说不出来我最爱的一首歌，说不出来我最爱的一个人。时常觉得人生其实没那么有趣。既然没那么有趣，不如自己去找点乐趣。以前学过oracle、linux、入门的java，现在前端ing...，不管咋样，我还是应该相信未来可期！

&emsp;&emsp;平常喜欢钓钓鱼、跑跑步、看看动漫、逛逛知乎和掘金，偶尔研究下学习，思维三部曲：WHAT、HOW、WHY（通过现象看本质），希望学习新知识后，能够通过博客记录下来，能够提升自己，能够写出好的博客。一来是对知识点的巩固，二来也算是生活中不可缺少的一个过程。

&emsp;&emsp;I can't say my favorite movie, my favorite song or my favorite person. I often feel that life is not that interesting. Since it's not that fun, it's better to have some fun yourself. Previously learned oracle, Linux, the beginning of Java, now front-end ing... No matter what, I still should believe in the future!

&emsp;&emsp;I like fishing, running, watching cartoons, browsing zhihu.com and digging gold. I occasionally study and think trilogy: WHAT, HOW and WHY (see the essence through the phenomenon). I hope I can record new knowledge through my blog so as to improve myself and write a good blog. One is the consolidation of the knowledge point, and the other is an indispensable process in life.
